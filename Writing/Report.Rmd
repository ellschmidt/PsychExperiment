This is a conceptual replication of experiment 6 of J. Phillips et.al. in the Oxford Studies in Experimental Philosophy Vol. 1, Chapter 10 "The Good in Happiness".

In the first five experiments in this chapter it became clear, that normative evaluations fo a persons life influenced the ordinary judgment of happiness of that person [cf.@phillips]. The 6th experiment, in an attempt to clarify on this insight, was designed to find out where exactly the normative judgment applied: on the agents *actual* life or on the life he or she *believed* to be living. 

A story about a character named Sarah was created. She worked in a childrens hospital and it was clearly stated, that she was very happy about this situation, specifically making sure that the participants understood her to have "high levels of positive affect, low levels of negative affect and high life-satisfaction"[@phillips]. In half the stories she thought herself to be harming children, in the other half to be helping them. Eventually the story continued to reveal that her actions turned out to be good or bad 10 years later. Combinig all the possibile instances, four vignettes for Sarahs life were created.




The reasons this experiment wasn't replicated exactly, were

1. the fact that when Sarah was intenting to hurt the children, but eventually happened to help them, the rating of her actual life value was surprisingly low, even lower than when her bad intention and outcome aligned. 

    The reason for that was believed to be in the usage of the word *pesticide* in this context. Since the is already a negative connotation of this term in connection with ingestions, it might have been harder for participants to believe that it helped the children on some level.

2. the effect of Sarahs actions weren't huge. Only *some of the children* got better or more sick. 

To attend to both flaws the stories for this replication were made more abstract to avoid any inclinations people might have about certain terms or personal afflictions and more drastic, so as to make it a bit clearer that the characters life value actually changed with their action and the result.

In addition two hypotheses were formulated to be able to make some generalizations about the data:

A) If intention and actual outcome align, the character will be perceived as happier
than when they do not align. (directional)

B) In the evaluation of the actual life of the story character, the outcome has more
influence on the value than the intent. (directional)

## Design

Participants will see a story about a fictitious character. They are asked to think about how happy the character is and adjust a slider, ranging from "not happy" to "very happy", accordingly. Only when the slider-button has been moved, a next-button will appear and allow the participant to continue. 

## Participants

**Recruitment:** Subjects will be recruited via mailing lists at the University of Osnabrück, as well as social media (Facebook) of the author. Participants will not be paid. 

**Inclusion/Exclusion:** Anyone without sufficient understanding of the English language cannot take part in the study.  *(technische constraints?)*  

## Materials

The characters and stories are all fictitious and introduced as aliens and a situation concerning their respective planet. There are two main components to each story, good or evil intent, and good or bad outcome, making up four conditionsets of (intent/outcome). 
Each story consists of three parts. For one character the first part will always be the same, describing the initial situation. The second part will be randomly assigned to either good or evil intent. The third part will contain the outcome, which is unique though to the intent chosen beforehand, i.e. the third part is different for good outcome/good intent and good outcome/evil intent. So the story-combinations for one character branch out like a tree instead of a network.

## Procedure

The task is very shortly explained on the *introductory screens*.

As there are four different conditionsets and also four different characters, participants will have four trials, each with a random combination of a character and a conditionset.
Participants must read through the story and then decide, how happy or not happy the character is. They adjust a slider and only then get the option to continue. 

There will be no practice trials as it is assumed that adjusting a slider is straightforward and easily manageable. 

At the end participants see a *post test screen*, where they can leave additional information about their person. This is optional. 


## Data preparation & exploration

First we load tidyverse and read in our data.

```{r, warning= FALSE, message = FALSE}
library('tidyverse')
library('gridExtra')

mydata <- read.csv("C:/Users/Schmidt/Desktop/PsychExperiment/Data/finals.csv")

```

Participants with a reading time less than 20 seconds per trial are excluded.
```{r}
cut_variables <- mydata %>% subset(RT <=20000)
# look upt the particpant's ids
cut_variables %>% select('submission_id', 'RT') %>% group_by(submission_id) 
# take out these particpants
my_variables <- mydata %>% subset(submission_id != 188) %>% subset(submission_id != 111) %>% subset(submission_id != 97)
# count gender distribution
genders <- my_variables %>% group_by(gender) %>% summarize(x = n()/max(trial_number))
```

That leaves us with a total of `r nlevels(factor(my_variables$submission_id))` participants (`r genders[2,2]` female, `r genders[3,2]` male, `r genders[1,2]` unassigned). The mean age was `r mean(my_variables$age, na.rm=TRUE) %>% round(2)`, with a range [`r my_variables %>% select('age') %>% range(my_variables$age, na.rm=TRUE) `]. Participants were also able to provide information on their educational background.

```{r}
my_variables %>% group_by(education) %>% summarize(x = n()/max(trial_number))
```


## Analysis

```{r}
#tidy up the data
tidy_variables <- my_variables %>% subset(!RT <=20000) %>% gather(key = 'question_slider', value = 'rating', 'rating_slider', 'rating_slider_actual', 'rating_slider_perceived') %>% select('intent', 'outcome', 'question_slider', 'rating')

#scale the data
tidy_variables$rating <- tidy_variables$rating/100*7

#partitioning
happiness <- subset(tidy_variables, question_slider == 'rating_slider')
perceived <- subset(tidy_variables, question_slider == 'rating_slider_perceived')
actual <- subset(tidy_variables, question_slider == 'rating_slider_actual')

model_happiness <- lm(rating ~ intent * outcome, happiness)
model_perceived <- lm(rating ~ intent * outcome, perceived)
model_actual <- lm(rating ~ intent * outcome, actual)

summary(model_happiness)
summary(model_perceived)
summary(model_actual)
```

##Plotting
We can now create the same plots as in the original study.
```{r}
#calculate the mean of the different ratings
calculations <- aggregate(tidy_variables[, 4], list(tidy_variables$intent, tidy_variables$outcome, tidy_variables$question_slider), mean)

#rename the columns correctly
calculations <- select(calculations, intent=Group.1, outcome=Group.2, question_slider=Group.3, means=x)

# calculate the standard deviation respectively
standard_deviation <- aggregate(tidy_variables[, 4], list(tidy_variables$intent, tidy_variables$outcome, tidy_variables$question_slider), sd)
calculations[ , "std"] <- standard_deviation["x"] # add it to the data frame conatining the means

#create subsets for the three different plots
happiness_assessment <- subset(calculations, question_slider == 'rating_slider')
perceived_life <- subset(calculations, question_slider == 'rating_slider_perceived')
actual_life <- subset(calculations, question_slider == 'rating_slider_actual')


#one_happy <- 
  ggplot(happiness_assessment, aes(x=intent, y=means, fill=outcome)) + 
    ggtitle("Happiness Assessment") + 
    geom_bar(position=position_dodge(), stat="identity") + 
    geom_errorbar( aes(ymin=means-std, ymax=means+std), colour="orange", size=1.3, width=.2, position=position_dodge(width=0.9))

#two_perceived <- 
  ggplot(perceived_life, aes(x=intent, y=means, fill=outcome)) +
    ggtitle("Value of Perceived Life") + 
    geom_bar(position=position_dodge(), stat="identity") + 
    geom_errorbar( aes(ymin=means-std, ymax=means+std), colour="orange", size=1.3, width=.2, position=position_dodge(width=0.9))

#three_actual <- 
  ggplot(actual_life, aes(x=intent, y=means, fill=outcome)) +
    ggtitle("Value of Actual Life") + 
    geom_bar(position=position_dodge(), stat="identity") + 
    geom_errorbar( aes(ymin=means-std, ymax=means+std), colour="orange", size=1.3, width=.2, position=position_dodge(width=0.9))

#grid.arrange(one_happy, two_perceived, three_actual, ncol=3)
```


```{r include=FALSE}
happy_intent_angel <- happiness_assessment %>% subset(intent == 'angel')
happy_intent_devil <- happiness_assessment %>% subset(intent == 'devil')
happy_outcome_good <- happiness_assessment %>% subset(outcome == 'Good')
happy_outcome_bad <- happiness_assessment %>% subset(outcome == 'Bad')

perceived_intent_angel <- perceived_life %>% subset(intent == 'angel')
perceived_intent_devil <- perceived_life %>% subset(intent == 'devil')
perceived_outcome_good <- perceived_life %>% subset(outcome == 'Good')
perceived_outcome_bad <- perceived_life %>% subset(outcome == 'Bad')

actual_intent_angel <- actual_life %>% subset(intent == 'angel')
actual_intent_devil <- actual_life %>% subset(intent == 'devil')
actual_outcome_good <- actual_life %>% subset(outcome == 'Good')
actual_outcome_bad <- actual_life %>% subset(outcome == 'Bad')


```


## Results
The results of the **happiness assessment** differ slightly from the original results. In general they seem to be somewhat lower. Angel *intent* had a mean happiness rating of `r mean(happy_intent_angel$means) %>% round(2)` (original 6.67), while devil intent amounted to `r mean(happy_intent_devil$means) %>% round(2)`, which was the same as in the original.

Concerning simply the *outcome*, a positive outcome showed a mean of `r mean(happy_outcome_good$means) %>% round(2)` (original 5.96), while a bad outcome lead to a mean rating of `r mean(happy_outcome_bad$means) %>% round(2)` (original 5.83).


Looking at the **perceived life**, the *intent* varied as well, good intent being lower again with  `r mean(perceived_intent_angel$means) %>% round(2)` (original 6.33), while devil intent came up with a higher rating at `r mean(perceived_intent_devil$means) %>% round(2)` (original 5.07).
The *outcome* as had also been the case in the original study did not change the attribution of a good life significantly: good outcome `r mean(perceived_outcome_good$means) %>% round(2)` vs. bad outcome `r mean(perceived_outcome_bad$means) %>% round(2)`.



Now for the good-life-assessment for the **actual life devil** *intent* had a clearly lower rating `r mean(actual_intent_devil$means) %>% round(2)` (original 1.89) than angel intent `r mean(actual_intent_angel$means) %>% round(2)` (original 5.23), although they can be noticed to be closer together than in the original study. 
The *outcome* made a significant difference for the positive intent here as well: 
angel intent with good outcome `r actual_life[3,4] %>% round(2)` (original 6.00) vs. bad outcome `r actual_life[1,4] %>% round(2)` (original 4.57). 

devil intent with good outcome `r actual_life[4,4] %>% round(2)` vs. bad outcome `r actual_life[2,4] %>% round(2)`

in general: good outcome `r mean(actual_outcome_good$means) %>% round(2)` vs. bad outcome `r mean(actual_outcome_bad$means) %>% round(2)`.

## Discussion
The first hypotheses proposed that aligning intent and outcome would lead to a higher happiness rating that if they were not aligned. This theses could not be proven. The mean for devil intent/bad outcome was actually even lower than for devil intent/good outcome which might suggest, that participant's opinion played a role in their assessment. Theoretically as the change of the outcome to the better or worse occurred only after the story charater's death, the outcome should not cause a statistically significant difference in the assessment of happiness, which became also clear in the results.

The second hypotheses was concerned with the fact that ratings for value of the actual life should be much higher considering the outcome than the intent. Unfortunately data showed no support for this theory either. Although ratings were generally higher than in the original study, it could not be shown that outcome had a higher influence on the rating than intent. That suggests that the intention with which any action is executed plays an essential role in the assessment of how good a life is, while outcome seems to be a secondary factor. 
As humans we award other creatures or humanoids the possibility to act intentional, which  importantly is coupled to emotion and therefore can be held accountable by moral standards (opposed to machines, who mighth have implemented moral standards, but only if the creator wished so, but do not have emotion). Further intention is a state of mind that seems to be subordinate to will, as a person can decide to act with a specific intent or without it. The outcome on the other hand can generally be affected by multiple events or occurrences, that are far beyond the reach of a single person, at the least far beyond the control of intent, which is why intent plays a more important role in the judgement than the outcome.
