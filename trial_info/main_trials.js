	{question: "After working at a horse farm for several years, Paul got a job at the \
			   as the main trainer and rides many different horses each day. This is the \
			   job he has always wanted. Almost every single day Paul feels good and generally \
			   experiences a lot of pleasant emotions. In fact, it is very rare that he \
			   would ever feel negative emotions like sadness or loneliness. When Paul \
			   thinks about his life, he always comes to the same conclusion: he feels highly \
			   satisfied with the way he lives. \
			   The reason Paul feels this way is that he tries to support the horses by \
			   riding them with a special saddle. \
			   Ten years after Paul died, a new discovery was made which suggested \
			   that the saddle had made some of the horses stronger."},
